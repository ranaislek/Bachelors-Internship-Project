I have done my two months online internship at Delivery Hero Tech Hub Turkey as a Product 
Analyst Intern. Since Yemeksepeti was sold to the global company Delivery Hero in 2015, all Yemeksepeti 
workers were shifted to Delivery Hero and a new Tech Hub was founded with Yemeksepeti engineers. Our 
team consisted of six people including two interns and all team members were working on different global 
projects.  

When I started the internship, the team was working on creating a brand-new dashboard that shows 
all data of Delivery Hero in a compact and reasonable way, and at the end all C-Levels will check this report 
on a daily basis. In this context, our project was about calculating the micro conversion rates of Delivery 
Hero brands with respect to countries. To calculate these, we used several methods and tools which I 
described in a detailed way in the following sections. The most used tool was BigQuery since we were coding 
using SQL.  

The project was so helpful in fully understanding what we have learned at the beginning of the 
internship, and it gave us a chance to experience real-life usage of the tools we have learned. At the end of 
my internship, I and my project mate represented our findings with a slideshow and a dashboard using Data 
Studio, that was a big experience for me to make a representation to my team. My recommendation to future 
CS395 Project students is to start searching for their internship at the beginning of the second semester of 
the third year to be relaxed and to be on time.
